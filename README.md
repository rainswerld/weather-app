### Weather Where You Are: Simple Weather App

This app was built in 2 days as a challenge for myself to learn more about React Hooks and working with 3rd party APIs.

## Tech:

In this app, I use the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) to get weather data depending on what city is entered in the search bar.

I also use the [Unsplash API] to get a new random image with the specific query `'epic nature'` every time the full app component is rendered.

# Full tech stack:
- Javascript
- React Hooks
- HTML
- CSS
- OpenWeather API
- Unsplash API
